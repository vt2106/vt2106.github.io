      <h2>This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to cookieandkate.com.</h2>

     <ul>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <li>1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread)</li>
       <li>1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)</li>
       <li>1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
       <li>Toppings (go wild!)</li>
       </ul>
     <ol>
       <h3>Instructions</h3>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
       <li>Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below). </li>
       <li>Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges.</li>
       <li>Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.</li>
   <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned.</li>
       <li>Slice and serve.</li>
     </ol>

     <h4>Notes</h4>

   <p>If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead. Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes. Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.</p>

   <p>Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!</p>
   <p>Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad.</p>

     <h3>Topping ideas:</h3>

   <li>As shown: barbecue sauce (trust me), fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</li>
   <li>Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers (jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes.</li>
   <li>Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella (optional), fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).</li>
     <li>Red pepper pesto and goat cheese. Anything you want!</li>
